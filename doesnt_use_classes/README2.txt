This folder is the kid of 'castaways' of this project: most of these are fully functioning,
but they do not rely on the cards_class.py and therefore are not truly part of the card games
final project. HOWEVER, I didn't want to delete them so they are instead hidden away in this folder. 
They do not affect the overall project at all. They're ghosts basically.
